# PythonText CLI Python basic text editor

CLI Text Editor is a simple command-line text editor implemented in Python. It allows you to create new text files, edit existing ones, and save changes back to disk.

## Getting Started

To run the CLI Text Editor, you'll need to have Python installed locally.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/turingblocks/PythonText.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd TextEditor.py
    ```

### Usage

To start the text editor with a new or existing file, use the following command:

    ```
    python text_editor.py filename.txt
    ```


Replace `filename.txt` with the name of the file you want to create or edit.

Once the editor is running, you can use the following commands:

- `ADD <line>`: Adds a new line at the end of the text. Replace `<line>` with the content of the line.
- `EDIT <line_number> <new_content>`: Edits an existing line. Replace `<line_number>` with the line number and `<new_content>` with the new content.
- `SAVE`: Saves the changes to the file.

- `QUIT`: Exits the editor without saving.
